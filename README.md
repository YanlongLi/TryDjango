1. Create Project
```
django-admin startproject cs411
```
A project named cs411 will be created, with defautl settings and url mappings.

Next, we can add your personal url mappings and views to handle the url requests.

2. Add a module where we can put our codes to. Say `snoopy`

3. Allow connection from all IPs.

4. Then we can add our views and models in module `snoopy`.
